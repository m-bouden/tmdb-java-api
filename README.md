## Project Structure

Node is required for generation and recommended for development. `package.json` is always generated for a better development experience with prettier, commit hooks, scripts and so on.

In the project root, JHipster generates configuration files for tools like git, prettier, eslint, husk, and others that are well known and you can find references in the web.

`/src/*` structure follows default Java structure.

- `com.api.tv` : main package.
  - `service` : package for service beans.
  - `model` : package for response models.
  - `tools` : package for tools such as TmdbApiConfiguration and GenericApiCall.
  - `web.rest` : package for REST controllers.
